C# Unity Development Area.


Currently just feeling my way through the Unity dev environment. But I have a game idea:

   Ballr - A portamento on Steve Ballmer and Rollerball. The Game is just in the phase of initial learning demo standard (using the Unity Demos). But there is a full development-road layout. The alpha demo will be based upon an old 80s arcade game similar to Crystal Castles crossed with qbert crossed withi billiards.
